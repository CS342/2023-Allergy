Patch testing is a diagnostic test that helps identify substances that may cause an allergic reaction on the skin leading to contact dermatitis (contact dermatitis is a common type of eczema).

Here are the steps to help you perform patch testing:

1. Identify healthy areas of your skin; on your arms, forearms, or thighs, free of any pre-existing rashes, to apply each allergen panel (if you have help, panels may be applied on the upper back as well) and take baseline photos of these areas before applying the allergens.
