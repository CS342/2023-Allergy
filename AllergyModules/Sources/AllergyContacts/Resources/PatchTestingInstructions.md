Patch testing is a diagnostic test that helps identify substances that may cause an allergic reaction on the skin leading to contact dermatitis (contact dermatitis is a common type of eczema).

Here are the steps to help you perform patch testing:

1. Identify healthy areas of your skin; on your arms, forearms, or thighs, free of any pre-existing rashes, to apply each allergen panel (if you have help, panels may be applied on the upper back as well) and take baseline photos of these areas before applying the allergens.

2. Open the packages that contain the allergen panels.

3. Follow the instructions on the package to apply the allergen panels on the areas of skin that you have chosen and photographed earlier. Use the marking provided in the package to mark the skin around each panel.

4. Take photos right after applying the allergens, then wait for 48 hoursThe patches are left in place for 48 hours. During this time, keeping the tapes in place and avoiding engagement in activities that may cause sweating or peeling off the tapes from your skin is important. 

5. After 48 hours, remove the allergen panels, but keep the markings around each allergen panel for another two days (this would allow monitoring of the reactions to each allergen). 

6. Right after removing the allergens, take another set of photos from each site (make sure the markings remain in place for at least another 2 days). Avoid applying topical medication on the allergen application sites as it may alter the final results.

7. Take another set of photos two days after removing the allergens. At this point, after taking the images, removing the markings on your skin is okay. 

8. Allow time for our team to interpret the results and provide a response.
